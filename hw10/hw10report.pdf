Q78:B If the curly brackets were around while loop indention, answer would be 9.
import java.time.*;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int count=0;
    LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2017,Month.JANUARY,1);
    while(date.getMonth()!=Month.APRIL)
      date=date.minusMonths(1);
      count++;
    
    System.out.println(count);
  }
}
