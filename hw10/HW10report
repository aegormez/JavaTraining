Q30: E,F: Firstly you should state min and max as static to make static reference to them
and then you dont have to set min =0 since its default
Q31: B,E only one right hand side will be evaluated for ternary expressions, 
an if statement cant have multiple else statements, | and || are different operators
Q32: C StringBuilder.delete(int,int) method will delete the char at begining point but wont
delete the char at ending point, if they collide, char wont be deleted(ending point will overcome
starting point)
Q33: A method names cannot include characters (-,\,$,%,etc) but _ is ok !
Q34: A,C Overriding wont change behaviour of other methods in superclass. Also all java classes
have some family tree which inherits from superclasses or inherited by subclasses. Inheritance doesnt aim 
to make everything complicate, simpler in reverse.
Q35: E All true
Q36: C multiple dimensional arrays in java are different than languages like matlab, in fact
there is no multi-dimensional arrays in java. there are only arrays that have another arrays
as their elements. so length method will give the # of elements (even if they are array or single elements)
Q37: A,B,E a switch statement tests expressions based only on a single integer, enumerated value, or String object.
Q38: D code will not compile ofc, d is not defined. wtf ?
Q39: B,C,E valid comment lines are /* ...... */ and //......
Q40: A,F we should either import all seperately or with using .* but in both case it must be static

Q51: E "for" loop is designed to be downcounting but its written container++, if it was counter-- then code would compile 
without any exception.
Q52: A,E,F Addition to A and F, option E is also possible (final main method).
Q53: C,D,E for lines 10 and 12 possible loosy conversion
Q54: A,B,C lines h1, h2 and h3 do not compile due to reduce of visibility of a mthod defined in interface
Q55: B,E,F RuntimeException class and its subclasses are unchecked exceptions.
Q56: F None of the above because it prints "goodbye" and "see you again"
Q57: B,D are compilable options
Q58: A It will print "15". Diamond class will affect CarbonStructure class's count with super method.
Q59: C Lines 6 and 8 give compile error (cannot find symbol)
Q60: A,E General concept is a "try" block must be followed by a catch or finally block or both.
More than one catch block is possible but the same is not possible for finally blocks.
Q61: B two integers are added via '+' operator in printing line even if they are followed by a string

Q70: B context of static method main is changed in another method (not static) so they will keep their last values.
Q71: B "ex" inside another catch loop exception named "ex" duplicates terms.
Q73: B "==" operator gives "false" because bike2 is created with "new" phrase. Contents are the same so "equals" results in "true"
Q74: E Code compiles but throws ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception in runtime.
Q75: C,D,E: Do-while loops may not be converted to for-each loops due to their natural behaviour of running the code inside block once.
Other loops can be converted by using "length" methods etc.
Q76: E Code does not compile.
Q77:   0 objects are available for garbage collector.
Q78:B If the curly brackets were around while loop indention, answer would be 9.
import java.time.*;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int count=0;
    LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2017,Month.JANUARY,1);
    while(date.getMonth()!=Month.APRIL)
      date=date.minusMonths(1);
      count++;
    
    System.out.println(count);
  }
}
