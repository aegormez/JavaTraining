Q70: B context of static method main is changed in another method (not static) so they will keep their last values.
Q71: B "ex" inside another catch loop exception named "ex" duplicates terms.

Q74: E Code compiles but throws ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception in runtime.
Q75: C,D,E: Do-while loops may not be converted to for-each loops due to their natural behaviour of running the code inside block once.

Q76: E Code does not compile.
Q77:   0 objects are available for garbage collector.
Q78:B If the curly brackets were around while loop indention, answer would be 9.
